# Real-Time Admin Dashboard Implementation Summary

## What Was Modified

### 1. Dependencies Added
- Added `websocket` dependency to `Ballerina.toml`

### 2. New Types Added to `types.bal`
- `WebSocketMessage`: For WebSocket communication
- `RealTimeStats`: For real-time statistics data
- `ClientConnection`: For managing WebSocket client connections
- `RealTimeNotification`: For real-time notifications

### 3. Enhanced `admin_service.bal`

#### WebSocket Infrastructure
- **Global Connection Management**: Maps to store active WebSocket connections and client information
- **WebSocket Service**: New service running on port 9095 at `/dashboard/admin/ws`
- **AdminWebSocketService Class**: Handles WebSocket lifecycle events (onOpen, onMessage, onClose, onError)

#### Real-Time Features
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- **Periodic Updates**: Background task sending stats updates every 30 seconds
- **Broadcast Functionality**: Send messages to all admin users in an organization
- **Connection Cleanup**: Automatic removal of failed/closed connections

#### New REST Endpoints
1. **POST `/dashboard/admin/notify`**: Manually trigger real-time stats updates
2. **POST `/dashboard/admin/notification`**: Send custom notifications to connected admins
3. **GET `/dashboard/admin/connections`**: View active WebSocket connections (SuperAdmin only)

#### Enhanced Service Management
- **Start Function**: Initializes periodic update task and logs startup information
- **Stop Function**: Cleanup function for graceful shutdown

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **HTML Test Client**: `websocket-test-client.html` for testing WebSocket functionality
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: `README_REALTIME.md` with usage examples

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-Time Dashboard Statistics
- Live updates of user counts, meal events, asset requests, and maintenance requests
- Monthly data arrays for charts and graphs
- Automatic refresh every 30 seconds
- Manual trigger capability

### WebSocket Communication Protocol
- Structured message format with event types
- Authentication flow with JWT tokens
- Error handling and status reporting
- Ping/pong for connection health checks

### Security & Access Control
- JWT-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- Role-based access (Admin/SuperAdmin only)
- Organization-based isolation
- Automatic connection termination for invalid tokens

### Connection Management
- Automatic cleanup of failed connections
- Connection tracking by organization
- Support for multiple concurrent admin connections
- Graceful handling of connection errors

## Architecture Benefits

### Scalability
- Stateless HTTP service with stateful WebSocket connections
- Organization-based message broadcasting
- Efficient periodic update mechanism
- Automatic resource cleanup

### Maintainability
- Clean separation of HTTP and WebSocket services
- Modular function design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging and monitoring

### Performance
- Minimal database queries for real-time updates
- Efficient connection management
- Background task optimization
- Non-blocking WebSocket operations

## Integration Points

### Frontend Integration
- WebSocket client implementation examples for React and Vue
- REST API endpoints for manual triggers
- Structured message format for easy parsing
- Error handling guidelines

### Backend Integration
- Function exports for triggering notifications from other modules
- Service lifecycle management
- Database query optimization
- Task scheduling integration

## Testing & Monitoring

### Test Client Features
- WebSocket connection testing
- Authentication flow testing
- Real-time update visualization
- API endpoint testing
- Connection status monitoring

### Monitoring Capabilities
- Connection count tracking
- Error logging and reporting
- Performance metrics
- Service health checks

## Deployment Considerations

### Port Configuration
- HTTP Service: Port 9092 (existing)
- WebSocket Service: Port 9095 (new)

### Security Configuration
- CORS settings for development and production
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Connection timeout settings

### Performance Tuning
- Update frequency configuration (currently 30 seconds)
- Connection limit recommendations
- Database query optimization
- Memory usage monitoring

This implementation transforms the static admin dashboard into a dynamic, real-time monitoring system that provides live updates and notifications to connected administrators.
